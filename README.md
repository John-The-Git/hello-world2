# hello-world2
As suggested by Git-hub I'm using this as a public notice-board (to "store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others")
My name is (chika chika) ... Slim Shady! a.k.a. John-The-Git. I am currently awaiting viva for my PhD, having submitted the thesis last month. I am looking to learn coding, to open up new career opportunities.
